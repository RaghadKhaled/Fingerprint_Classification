### Project overview

Fingerprints identification and verification systems have been used widely in most important applications in order to ensure public security. Fingerprints are unique and are the most reliable human feature which can be utilized for personal identification. In this project, we aim to build a Machine Learning model to classify fingerprint images into four types: arch, right loop, left loop and whorl.

### Data description

We use the Fingerprint Verification Competition (FVC) 2004 dataset. It consists of fingerprint images of four different types of fingerprints. The dataset has been collected with different types of sensors. You can download the dataset and see more detailed information in this [link](http://bias.csr.unibo.it/fvc2004/databases.asp).
